# MPU6050_ESP8266_MQTT

A project to send acceleration (vibration) values from a MPU6050 sensor as MQTT messages through a ESP8266 module.

The project consists of these parts:
1.  Circuit diagram showing MPU6050 connected to a ESP8266 based nodeMCU module.
2.  Arduino sketch for the ESP8266.
3.  Steps to install and configure a MQTT broker on a Windows computer.
4.  Steps to capture the values and store in a file in CSV format along with timestamp.
5.  Steps to visualize the data in a chart in real time using MQTT-Spy.
